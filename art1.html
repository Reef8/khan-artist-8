    <p>This piece pays homage to Jahangir Khan, arguably the greatest squash player of all time. During his legendary career, he had one of the most impressive winning streaks of all time where he won 555 matches in a row! A streak that lasted nearly 5.5 years. This specific piece—inspired by this winning streak—was created by hitting a paint covered squash ball against the canvas 555 times. A unique piece that melds art and sport.
